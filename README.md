# Android Debloat List
A fork of comprehensive list of apps that come preinstalled with many ROMs + scripts to actually remove/disable them AND re-installing/re-enabling them in case something goes wrong.

# The script that I have added are located in scripts/.
Run debloat.sh to "remove" the applications from that list for the active user. Obviously, it doesn't actually remove it from the OS entirely, it basically just hides it for the active user. In case something goes wrong, re-install them with rebloat.sh or, if you used debloat-disable.sh rebloat-enable.sh.
